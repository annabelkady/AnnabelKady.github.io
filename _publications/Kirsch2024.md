title: "Early life stress is associated with greater negative emotionality and peripheral inflammation in alcohol use disorder"
collection: publications
permalink: /_publications/Kirsch2024
excerpt: 'This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the impact of early life stress (ELS) in AUD, suggesting that high-ELS (4+ ACEs) is associated with a greater negative emotionality and elevated CRP. ELS was not associated with incentive salience, thereby indicating a dissociation of the effects of ELS on AUD phenomenology. This study found support for the overarching hypothesis that individuals with and without a history of ELS and the same primary DSM-5 diagnosis are clinically and biologically distinct in the context of AUD [11, 12], and suggests that tailored treatments for this group, including neuroimmune modulators, are in need of investigation.'
