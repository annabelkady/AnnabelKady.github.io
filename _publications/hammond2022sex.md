This paper examined sex-based differences in psychiatric symptoms and relationships among sex, psychiatric symptoms, and opioid use outcomes in youth with OUD receiving buprenorphine/naloxone (Bup/Nal) and psychosocial treatment. We found that clinically significant sex-based differences in psychiatric symptoms are present at baseline among youth with opioid use disorder receiving Bup/Nal-assisted treatment and mostly resolve during treatment.
